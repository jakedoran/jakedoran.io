		<h1 class="heading-room">turned viral success</h1>

		<p>It's easy to get sucked into a nostalgic listening session, but tracking down the songs of your youth can be tougher than you think -- and "best of" medleys on YouTube will only do so much to scratch the itch.</p>

		<p>Don't worry, though, as The Nostalgia Machine has come to save the day. Pick a year and you'll see an easy-to-digest list of pop music videos that might just remind you of your high school prom or that big college party.</p>
